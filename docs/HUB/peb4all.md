!!! abstract "Abstract"

    **PEB4ALL** is a comprehensive digital platform developed by EURAC Research that addresses the critical challenge of high energy costs and environmental impact from buildings, which are responsible for over one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The platform serves as an accessible resource for understanding and implementing **Plus Energy Buildings (PEBs)** - energy-efficient buildings that produce more final energy than they consume via locally available renewable sources while maintaining the lowest greenhouse gas emissions. PEB4ALL provides practical information, cost-benefit analysis, and real-world examples to help individuals, professionals, and policymakers understand how PEBs can reduce energy bills, save money, and significantly reduce carbon footprints. The platform emphasizes that PEBs are not just environmentally beneficial but also economically advantageous, offering 50% fewer emissions than nearly-zero energy buildings while providing stable, renewable energy that is unaffected by market fluctuations.

## Introduction

### The Housing Energy Crisis

**"Housing is exhausting"** - this statement captures the reality faced by millions of Europeans dealing with escalating energy bills and environmental concerns. Spending too much on energy bills is a major problem. For us, and for the environment: building today are responsible for over one third of the greenhouse gas emissions. The European building sector stands at a critical juncture where immediate action is required to address both economic burden on households and the urgent climate crisis.

### What are Plus Energy Buildings?

An energy efficient building that produces more final energy than it uses, via locally available renewable sources. The positive balance shall be reached while ensuring the lowest greenhouse gas emissions. PEBs represent a revolutionary approach to building design and operation that transforms structures from energy consumers into energy producers.

#### Key Characteristics of PEBs:

**Energy Production vs. Consumption**
- **Produces more energy than consumed** throughout the year
- **100% clean and renewable** energy from local sources
- **Surplus energy** fed into the electricity network or shared with surrounding buildings

**Advanced Building Systems**
- **Fully electric energy systems** with heat pumps powered by renewable sources
- **Photovoltaic installations** with battery storage for energy surplus
- **Smart building management** systems that autonomously optimize performance
- **Well-insulated and airtight building envelope** minimizing heat loss/gain

**Environmental and Economic Benefits**
- **50% fewer emissions** than nearly-zero energy buildings (nZEB)
- **Significant cost savings** through minimal energy purchase requirements
- **Price stability** unaffected by energy market fluctuations
- **Enhanced indoor comfort** and healthier living environments

### The European Context and Future Standards

PEBs are ahead of the game! The new European Directive mandates zero emissions standards by 2030, and PEBs go a step beyond that. This positions PEB4ALL as a forward-thinking platform that not only addresses current challenges but also prepares stakeholders for future regulatory requirements.

### Beyond Individual Benefits: Community Impact

PEBs contribute to broader environmental goals by supporting areas with older buildings. This surplus energy is fed into the electricity network or shared with surrounding buildings. In this way PEBs can support areas with older buildings, helping not only to reduce your carbon footprint, but that of your neighbourhood. This community-centered approach makes PEBs catalysts for neighborhood-wide sustainability improvements.

### Understanding PEB Technology

#### Smart Building Systems
PEBs are smart buildings. Buildings are considered "smart" when they can manage resource autonomously, maximising efficiency in consumption while maintaining optimal internal conditions.

**Autonomous Resource Management:**
- **Intelligent system regulation** for heating, cooling, lighting, and energy storage
- **Optimization algorithms** that improve comfort while maximizing efficiency
- **User participation opportunities** to enhance energy balance through demand management

#### Energy System Components

**Heat Pump Technology**
The building's energy system is fully electric, consisting of heat pumps powered by renewable sources, typically photovoltaics, along with batteries that store surplus energy. These heat pumps replace traditional heating and cooling systems, such as boilers and air conditioners. Heat pumps are significantly more efficient than conventional systems, as they move heat rather than generate it.

**Building Envelope Optimization**
The building envelope is well-insulated and airtight, minimising heat loss or gain, which helps maintain indoor temperatures at comfortable levels and reduces energy consumption for heating and cooling.

### Economic Benefits and Cost Analysis

#### Financial Advantages
Living in a PEB can help you save money. A PEB is so efficient that it requires very little energy to stay warm in winter and cool in summer. The energy is produced by the building itself, minimising the need to purchase power from the electricity network at much higher costs.

**Cost Stability Features:**
- **Renewable energy independence** reducing grid dependency
- **Protection from market volatility** through on-site energy production
- **Long-term financial predictability** with stable energy costs

#### Investment Considerations

**Maintenance and Technology Costs**
The platform addresses common concerns about maintenance: Well, not really! The technologies in a PEB are more advanced than standard ones, which generally makes maintenance more complex and therefore more expensive. Butâ€¦ The platform provides balanced information about both benefits and challenges, ensuring informed decision-making.

### Environmental Impact and Sustainability

#### Carbon Footprint Reduction
A PEB can produce 50% fewer emissions than a nearly-zero energy building, which is the European Union's standard for meeting sustainability targets. The energy generated by a PEB is 100% clean and sustainable, produced from locally available renewable energy sources.

**Sustainability Features:**
- **Significant emission reductions** compared to current EU standards
- **100% renewable energy sources** eliminating fossil fuel dependence
- **Local energy production** reducing transmission losses and infrastructure strain

#### Community Environmental Benefits

**Neighborhood Support System:**
- **Surplus energy sharing** with surrounding buildings
- **Grid stability contribution** through distributed energy production
- **Local resilience enhancement** reducing dependency on centralized energy systems

### Design Guidelines and Implementation

#### The Seven Key Design Principles
7 key design principles will guide you in creating Plus Energy Buildings and comfortable, healthy, and environmentally responsible spaces for people to live well in. These principles should guide the design of Plus Energy Buildings across all phases of the building's life.

**User-Centered Design Approach:**
Comfort isn't just about temperature: it's closely tied to meeting people's needs. Even when people know how to use the advanced technologies in their homes, they often override these systems if they don't feel comfortable.

**Behavioral Integration Strategy:**
- **Understand conflicting behaviors** that reduce building efficiency
- **Identify underlying needs** driving user actions
- **Recognize current strategies** residents use to meet their needs
- **Incorporate design trade-offs** balancing efficiency and usability
- **Involve residents** in the design process whenever possible

#### Energy Balance Achievement

**Production Requirements:**
To produce energy, Plus Energy Buildings rely on renewable energy systems like solar panels or wind turbines. These systems must be located on the building's property or nearby areas that are physically connected and under the same ownership or management.

**Design Challenges and Solutions:**
Despite low operational energy needs (heating, cooling, ventilation, etc.), the high energy consumption of household appliances often exceeded what could be offset

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Reduce appliance energy use** and educate residents on efficient usage
- **Add PV systems beyond building roofs** on nearby structures or shared solar farms
- **Optimize system sizing** for economic performance and energy flexibility
