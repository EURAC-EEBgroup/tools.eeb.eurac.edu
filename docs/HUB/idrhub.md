# Industrialised Deep Renovation (IDR) Hub 

!!! abstract "Abstract"

    **Reno-Hub** is a comprehensive digital platform developed by EURAC Research that focuses on **Industrialised Deep Renovation (IDR)** - an innovative approach to upgrade existing buildings by combining deep renovation principles with industrialised construction methods. The platform serves as a knowledge hub and collaborative space for energy-efficient building renovation, featuring prefabricated retrofit solutions, business models, and case studies that demonstrate substantial energy performance improvements. Reno-Hub supports the European Union's ambitious climate neutrality goals by providing stakeholders with access to robust, cost-effective renovation packages that target 60-75% energy consumption reductions while minimizing construction time and tenant disruption through digital-aided offsite manufacturing of building components.


## Introduction

The European building renovation sector faces unprecedented challenges in achieving the EU's climate neutrality goals while addressing a rapidly aging building stock. With the annual amount of deep renovations in the EU28 at only around 0.2%, there is an urgent need for innovative approaches that can accelerate renovation rates while ensuring quality, affordability, and minimal disruption. Reno-Hub emerges as EURAC Research's response to these challenges, combining cutting-edge research with practical implementation strategies.

### The Challenge of Deep Renovation

Traditional renovation approaches often fall short of the EU's ambitious energy reduction targets, which require:
- **75% or more energy reductions** compared to existing building status
- **Primary energy consumption below 60 kWh/m²/yr** after renovation
- Addressing essential building elements including wall insulation, thermal bridge treatment, and comprehensive building envelope improvements

### Industrialised Deep Renovation (IDR): A Paradigm Shift

Reno-Hub champions **Industrialised Deep Renovation**, which revolutionizes the renovation process through:

#### Core Principles
- **Deep Renovation Focus**: Targeting substantial energy performance improvements beyond conventional "light" renovation practices
- **Industrialised Methods**: Digital-aided offsite manufacturing of building components in controlled factory environments
- **Quality Assurance**: High precision manufacturing with minimal defects and consistent performance
- **Speed and Efficiency**: Significantly reduced on-site construction time and tenant disruption

#### Key Technologies and Approaches
- **Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA)**: Buildings designed specifically for off-site production and efficient on-site assembly
- **Prefabrication**: Manufacturing building components like walls, roof panels, and complete modules off-site
- **Modular Systems**: Standardized components that can be customized for specific building requirements
- **Digital Integration**: Advanced planning and coordination tools that optimize the entire renovation process

### Platform Objectives

Reno-Hub serves as a central resource for multiple stakeholder groups, addressing the complex ecosystem of building renovation through:

#### Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration
The platform functions as a **collaborative environment** where renovation professionals, researchers, building owners, and technology providers can share experiences, best practices, and innovative solutions.

#### Technology Showcase
Reno-Hub features real-world examples of successful IDR implementations, demonstrating proven technologies and their performance outcomes across different building types and climatic conditions.

#### Business Model Innovation
The platform addresses the economic challenges of deep renovation by showcasing viable business models that make IDR financially attractive to building owners, investors, and renovation service providers.
