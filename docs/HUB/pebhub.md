# Plus Energy Building (PEB) Hub  

!!! abstract "Abstract"

    PEBHub is a comprehensive digital platform developed by EURAC Research that serves as a central repository and knowledge hub for **Plus Energy Buildings (PEBs)** - energy-efficient buildings designed to produce more energy than they consume through locally available renewable sources. The platform showcases real-world PEB implementations, providing detailed information about technologies, performance metrics, and design strategies for buildings that not only meet their energy demands but also generate an energy surplus throughout the year while minimizing greenhouse gas production. PEBHub offers educational resources, case studies, design guidelines, and best practices for architects, engineers, building owners, and policymakers seeking to implement sustainable building solutions that contribute to Europe's zero-emission building stock target by 2050.


## Introduction

The European building sector faces an urgent challenge: **buildings in the EU are responsible for 40% of energy consumption and 36% of greenhouse gas emissions**, with the ambitious objective of achieving a zero-emission building stock by 2050, requiring the retrofit of 20,000 houses each day. In response to this challenge, EURAC Research has developed PEBHub as a comprehensive platform that advances the understanding and implementation of Plus Energy Buildings across Europe.

### What are Plus Energy Buildings?

Plus Energy Buildings represent a paradigm shift in sustainable construction, designed as energy-efficient buildings that use minimal energy for ordinary operations including:
- Heating, cooling, ventilation
- Lighting and electrical systems  
- Water heating
- User behavior-related consumption (appliances, controls)

What distinguishes PEBs from other energy-efficient buildings is their capability to **not only meet their energy demands but also produce an energy surplus throughout the year** using locally available renewable sources such as solar and wind power.

### Key Characteristics of PEBs

#### Smart Energy Systems
The energy efficiency of PEBs comes from several integrated factors:
- **Fully electric energy systems** with heat pumps powered by renewable sources
- **Photovoltaic installations** with battery storage for surplus energy
- **Heat pump technology** that moves heat rather than generates it (significantly more efficient than traditional boilers/AC)

#### Intelligent Building Management
PEBs are fundamentally **smart buildings** that:
- Manage resources autonomously
- Maximize efficiency while maintaining optimal internal conditions
- Intelligently regulate heating, cooling, lighting, and energy storage systems
- Enable user participation in energy demand management

### Platform Purpose and Scope

The PEBHub platform serves multiple stakeholder groups, providing essential resources for building professionals, researchers, policymakers, and building owners. Through its comprehensive database of real-world case studies, the platform demonstrates successful PEB implementations across various European climates and building typologies, from residential complexes to historic renovations and commercial buildings.

### Design Guidelines Utilization

#### The Seven Key Principles
PEBHub provides **seven key design principles** that guide the creation of Plus Energy Buildings, emphasizing:
- Understanding conflicting behaviors
- Identifying underlying needs
- Recognizing user strategies
- Incorporating trade-offs in design to balance energy efficiency and usability

#### User-Centered Design Approach
The platform emphasizes that **comfort isn't just about temperature** but is closely tied to meeting people's needs. Key considerations include:
- Involving residents in the design process whenever possible
- Recognizing that users often override systems if they don't feel comfortable
- Balancing advanced technology with practical usability

#### Energy Balance Understanding
Users can learn about the **Plus Energy Building energy balance concept**:

```
Energy Generated Onsite > Total Energy Consumed
```

Where:
- **Energy Generated** = Total primary energy generated onsite (PV, wind, etc.)
- **Energy Used** = Total primary energy load including heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, DHW, appliances, and plug loads

PEBs are designed to generate more energy than they consume, with extra energy available for sharing or selling as part of energy communities.
