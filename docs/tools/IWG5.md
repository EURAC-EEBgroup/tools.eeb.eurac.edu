# European Building stock - IWG5 Project

!!! abstract "Abstract"

    Building renovation optimization is complex and time-consuming, with solutions often non-generalizable across different buildings, necessitating the development of an accessible decision-making tool and comprehensive database for performance assessment. This online platform leverages a simulation-driven database containing energy baselines, renovation packages, costs, and environmental impacts for European residential and office building typologies, developed through extensive parametric building performance simulations across diverse architectural characteristics and climate conditions. The tool facilitates testing and comparison of different combinations of building components, materials, and energy systems across European climate zones, providing standardized performance assessments for evidence-based renovation decisions

# Introduction 

The IWG5 database aims to evaluate various renovation packages to optimize energy performance and environmental impact, facilitating decision-making in building renovations. This is crucial for meeting the EUâ€™s environmental targets, including a 55% net emissions reduction by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. The project integrates dynamic building performance simulation (BPS) with environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic life cycle cost (LCC) to evaluate renovation strategies across different scenarios. It considers factors such as building archetype, climate zone, occupant behavior, economic conditions, and building orientation. This unified framework provides a holistic evaluation of energy performance, economic feasibility, and environmental impact, addressing climate variability and future climate change scenarios to ensure renovation strategy resilience.Extensive simulations covering over 900,000 cases increase the granularity and applicability of the findings, making the tool valuable for professionals and policymakers
