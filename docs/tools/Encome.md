# ENCOME - ENergy COnservation MEasure tool

!!! abstract "Abstract"

    The Energy Conservation Tool is a comprehensive assessment platform that evaluates building energy performance improvements through Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) using advanced EN ISO 52016/52010 standards. Built on the open-source pyBuildingEnergy library developed with HE BuildOn and H2020 Infinite projects, it provides semi-dynamic energy calculations with hourly resolution, surpassing traditional static methods used in energy certificates. The tool enables assessment of both building envelope measures (insulation, windows) and system improvements (HVAC, photovoltaics) through integration with the 2050 Materials database of market-available components. By transitioning from static to dynamic hourly calculations, it delivers unprecedented accuracy for evidence-based energy renovation planning. This comprehensive approach supports building professionals in making informed decisions for sustainable building transformations and strategic renovation investments


## Introduction

ENCOME aims to assess improvements in the building's energy performance when energy improvement measures are implemented. 
The tool starts with an evaluation of the building’s baseline through an energy simulation based on EN ISO 52016 and 52010 standards. 
These standards, referenced for energy performance assessment in the revised EPBD, represent an improvement compared to the calculations applied in energy certificates. In fact, it shifts from a static calculation to a semi-dynamic calculation, where energy performance is evaluated not only on an annual and monthly basis but also on a daily and hourly basis. In this context, in collaboration with the HE BuildOn and H2020 Infinite projects, the first open-source software library (pyBuildingEnergy) available to the community has been developed, enabling the calculation of the building’s energy demand for heating and cooling using EN ISO 52016 and 52010. Additionally, the calculation of domestic hot water has been added to provide a more detailed and comprehensive assessment, up to on hourly basis. This library serves as the calculation engine for the tool, through which various assessments are carried out, both initial (baseline) and virtually applying new ECMs (Energy Conservation Measures)to the building allowing for better planning of real ECM developments for that building. The applicable ECMs pertain not only to the building envelope but also to the building systems. For the envelope, it is possible to assess new opaque components by defining layers that characterize walls, floors, and roofs, while for the transparent part, new window components can be defined. For the systems, it is possible to define windows with improved performance. To achieve this, a database based on market-available construction materials, components and systems can be accessed by collaboration with the company 2050 Materials, or entered directly by the user. The ECMs that can be implemented also target the deployment of renewable energy sources. In fact, in a dedicated section, it is possible to simulate the performance of the building if a photovoltaic system were to be installed. To do this, it is assumed that the building’s thermal load is generated by an electric generator or heat pump, with the energy demand partially met by the photovoltaic system.

The tool is based on the  following schema:

## User Guide

### INPUT
To simulate the tool some inputs are required (similar to the ones required for the EPC certification):

- **Building location**:
    Weather information, such as external temperature and solar radiation, useful for simulating the building, is directly taken from the **PVGIS**, using the dedicated API and providing the latitude and longitude of the building as input. In the tool, this information can be provided either by directly selecting the building on the map or by typing the building's address in the dedicated space

### ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASURES

it is possible to apply different ECMs to the building and evaluate both economic and energy impact to the building.
The ECM can be applied to:

    1)  The facade, changine the layer composition of the vertical opaque components
    2)  The roof, changine the layer composition of the vertical opaque components
    3)  The floor, changine the layer composition of the vertical opaque components
    4)  The windows, changine the layer composition of the vertical transparent components
    5)  The heating system, changine the performance of the generator

The tool simulates each individual ECM as well as combinations of multiple ECMs, when more than one is selected. In the end, it is possible to evaluate both the energy impact and the economic impact, if the investment cost for the ECM and the energy cost per kWh are provided.

### Photovoltaic simulation 
Photovoltaic Simulation (ECM) and Optimization. Photovoltaics simulation allows the user to assess how much photovoltaics capacity is needed when the energy consumption for heating is covered entirely by an electric generator (heat pump), and additional data is required including i. e., an annual profile of electricity consumption from appliances. The optimization provides a guide for the design of a photovoltaic plus battery energy storage system coupled with a heat pump for different locations and thus different climates in Europe. Through a multi-objective optimization approach applied to the six European geoclusters and applying different solution selection criteria, it is possible to obtain the optimal photovoltaic capacity (kWp) normalized over the thermal consumption of a reference building and the optimal capacity of the battery per kWp of photovoltaic (kWh/kWp) installed. Due to the normalization process, results can be generalized and can be used for designing similar systems in all buildings around Europe. The results must be intended as a support for designers for the early-design phase of such systems or as an initial guess for an iterative process in more advanced evaluations
