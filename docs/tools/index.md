## üèóÔ∏è Geoclustering Tool

The _Geoclustering Tool_ is a web application that allows users to cluster buildings based on their geospatial location and other relevant features. The tool is built using Python and is designed to be easy to use and understand. 
The actual versione analyze the Energy PErformance Certificate of the Pedmont region, Italy.
A sensitivity analysis is also available to evaluate the impact of different clustering parameters on a selected target.
