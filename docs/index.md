# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of the Energy Efficient Building Tools. ðŸ‘‹

The [EURAC Energy Efficient Building Tools platform](https://tools.eeb.eurac.edu) represents a comprehensive digital ecosystem developed by the [Energy Efficient Building (EEB)](https://www.eurac.edu/en/institutes-centers/institute-for-renewable-energy/research-group/energy-efficient-buildings) group at the Institute of Renewable Energy (EURAC) in Bolzano, Italy. The platform consolidates cutting-edge computational tools and methodologies for advancing energy efficiency and performance optimization in the built environment. This sophisticated web-based repository serves as a centralized hub where researchers, energy consultants, building professionals, and policymakers can access a diverse array of specialized instruments designed to address the complex challenges of sustainable building design, renovation, and management.

At its core, the platform embodies EURAC Research's commitment to bridging the gap between academic research and practical implementation in the building sector, offering tools that span from individual building performance analysis to large-scale building stock assessments. The platform's architecture reflects a holistic approach to building energy efficiency, encompassing not only technical performance metrics but also economic viability, environmental impact, and occupant comfort considerations that are essential for comprehensive decision-making in energy renovation projects.
