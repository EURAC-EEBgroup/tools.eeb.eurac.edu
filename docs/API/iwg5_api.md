# IWG5 API

!!! abstract "Abstract"
    
    The IWG5 API provides programmatic access to a comprehensive simulation-based database that includes energy consumption data, cost analysis, and environmental impact assessments for renovation packages applied to typical European residential and office buildings. Developed by EURAC Research as part of the Implementation Working Group on Energy Efficiency in Buildings (IWG5), the API enables seamless integration of building performance data into external applications and workflows. The platform offers detailed baselines for European residential and office buildings across five climate zones, including building envelope U-values, HVAC system types, and shading controls. Through its RESTful interface, users can filter, compare, and download parametric simulation results, life cycle assessments, and renovation scenario evaluations, supporting evidence-based decision-making for sustainable building renovation strategies across Europe.

# Introduction

The IWG5 API serves as the backbone of the IWG5 application. It allows users to access various simulated data from the IWG5 database, as well as obtain information about the different simulations performed. For straightforward use, it is recommended to interact directly with the IWG5 Application; however, if you wish to implement the API into your own calculations or workflows, you can do so easily through this service.
Additionally, the API is designed to be highly flexible, supporting custom integration with third-party tools and platforms. This enables architects, engineers, and energy consultants to incorporate advanced simulation results into their broader analysis and reporting processes. The secure framework also ensures that all sensitive building data and simulation results are protected, facilitating compliance with industry standards and privacy requirements. As the platform evolves, new features and endpoints can be added without disrupting ongoing analyses, ensuring that users benefit from continuous innovation and adaptability.
