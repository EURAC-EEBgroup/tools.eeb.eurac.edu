# BuildON API

!!! abstract "Abstract"

    The BuildOn API serves as the backend infrastructure for the BuildON benchmarking application, providing specialized endpoints for comprehensive building comfort and energy performance analysis. The platform generates targeted visualization charts that enable indoor comfort assessment and temporal performance comparisons across different evaluation periods. Through its integration capabilities with external tools and databases, the API empowers users to enhance building assessments with data-driven insights, supporting both routine evaluations and complex multi-building comparative studies. The secure, scalable architecture ensures data protection while maintaining flexibility for future technological and regulatory adaptations.


## Introduction

The API has been developed as the backend for the BuildON benchmarking application.

Its endpoints are primarily designed to analyze building comfort and energy performance, generating specific charts that help assess indoor comfort and compare it across different periods.
In addition to its core analytical functions, the API supports integration with external tools and databases, enabling users to enrich their building assessments with data-driven insights. This flexibility allows for the customization of simulations and reporting, making the platform suitable for both routine evaluations and complex, multi-building comparisons. The secure architecture ensures that sensitive building data remains protected, while the scalable design facilitates future enhancements and the addition of new analytical features as technological and regulatory standards evolve.
